"""
Pylint configuration for the University Course Prerequisite Planner project.

This file standardizes linting rules across the codebase and ensures that:
- long Cypher queries are allowed (max line length = 120)
- FastAPI and Pydantic patterns do not raise false warnings
- docstring parameter validation is enabled via docparams
- non-essential warnings are disabled to improve readability

The goal is to maintain clean, consistent, and maintainable code while
keeping the linting process aligned with the project’s architecture.
